machine learning is process of feeding input and output in a computer/model to get the program (relation between variables) which will convert those inputs into that output. 

Machine learning is essential for scenarios where traditional programming will become cumbersome due to too many variables and too many conditions (if else ladders).

Data analysis is analysing a dataset and creating graph to form relation between the quantities. 

Data mining is when you thoroughly search the dataset create patterns and then create a model to predict what will a new output will result in. 


Expert system - created with help of experts(books people etc) a code which will have all the scenarios covered and will act based on it.  ( Rule based programming ) 

Machine learning - it is not rule based programming . it analyses patters and create mathematical models in order to find answers of unknown inputs. (Here you have to provide features for model)
// efficiency stabilises after a threshold 

Deep learning - it is machine learning but the algorithms are different. it is based on biological model of neurons and here you dont have to provide features. it automatically identifies them and creates a mathematical model. 
// efficiency always grows as more data is provided.
