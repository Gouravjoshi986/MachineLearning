It is a data structure and is used everywhere in ml and dl. 
it is a CONTAINER where you store numbers(most cases) or strings etc. 

// O D Tensor --> Scalars 
a tensor with 0 dimension - a single number is called a scalar 
// you can use name.ndim function of numpy to get dimension. 

// 1 D Tensor --> vector -->a list of number 
it has one dimension and one axis    ( axis == dimension  and generally no of axis = rank = dimension )
array is also called vector    . eg vector = [1,2,3,4] this is a 1D tensor . but we can call it a 4D Vector also . (no of elements)

// 2 D Tensors ---> matrices   (Collection of vector)
// axis = 2 rank = 2 dimension = 2

// N D Tensors ----> Collection of n-1 d tensor 
// Shape of a tensor - (no of row,no of column) 
// size of tensor = no of row * no of column 

// A single row of a table is a 1d tensor - vector 
// the table / matrix is a 2d tensor 

eg of 3d tensors = NLP problem of speech conversion  eg HI A 
                                                        HI B
                                                        HI C    
            suppose HI = 1000  A= 0100  B = 0010   C = 0001 
            so this transforms to    [ [[1000][0100]]  [[1000][0010]] [[1000][0001]] ] 
            this is a 3d tensor  w
