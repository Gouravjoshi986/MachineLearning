Challenges faced while doing ml - > 
1. Data Collection     --> Api or Web Scraping 
2. Insufficient Data/Labelled Data  ->if you have very huge amount of data . algo doesnt matter much (unreasonable effectiveness of data)

3. Non Representive Data / Incomplete data  -> due to this wrong function is calculated [There can be Sampling Biases]
4. Poor Quality Data - > outliers / missing values / Too much Computation 
5. Irrelevant Features - > garbage in - garbage out 
6. Overfitting - An overfit model performs well on training data but not on new data. This is because the model memorizes the training data instead of generalizing to all types of data. 
The training data is too small 
The training data contains a lot of irrelevant information 
The model trains for too long on a single data set
7. Underfitting - Underfitting can cause a model to perform poorly on training data and generalize poorly to unseen data. It can happen when a model is too simple, or when there's not enough or the wrong type of data. For example, a linear regression model trained on a dataset with a polynomial relationship between the input and output variables will underfit.
// a machine learning problem that occurs when a model is unable to capture the relationship between input and output variables in a dataset 
8. Software Integration is complex as not every software supports it 
9. Offline Learning and Deployment as well as Cost Included with it


Applications : 
1. Retail store - To decide product placement // To collect data about users and sell it to marketing industry 
2. Banking - For giving loan ml is used to predict if you will pay loan or not 
3. Transpot -  Surge Pricing Scenario in Ola/Uber / Demand Forecasting 
4. Manufacturing - Predictive maintainence
